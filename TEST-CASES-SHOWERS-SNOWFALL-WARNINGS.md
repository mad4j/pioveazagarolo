# Test Cases: Showers and Snowfall Warning Icons

## Feature Description
Warning icons (colored triangles with exclamation marks) are displayed in the precipitation chart when showers or snowfall are forecast. The icon color represents the severity of the event.

## Severity Levels and Colors

| Severity | Condition | Color | Hex Code |
|----------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Light | > 0 and ≤ 1 mm/h equivalent | Yellow | #f1c40f |
| Medium | > 1 and ≤ 5 mm/h equivalent | Orange | #f39c12 |
| Heavy | > 5 mm/h equivalent | Red | #e74c3c |

**Note**: Snowfall is converted to water equivalent (1 cm snow ≈ 10 mm water) for severity calculation.

## Test Case 1: Light Showers

**Expected Result**:
- Red warning triangles displayed
- Icon color clearly indicates high severity

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Screenshot**: See "Oggi" card at hours 19-21 in test screenshots

## Test Case 4: Light Snowfall
**Test Data**:
- Showers: 0 mm/h
- Snowfall: 0.3-0.5 cm/h (3-5 mm water equivalent)

**Expected Result**:
- Orange warning triangles displayed
- Correct severity calculation for snowfall

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Screenshot**: See "Domani" card at hours 3-4 in test screenshots

---

## Test Case 5: Medium to Heavy Snowfall
**Test Data**:
- Showers: 0 mm/h
- Snowfall: 1.2-2.5 cm/h (12-25 mm water equivalent)

**Expected Result**:
- Red warning triangles displayed for heavy snowfall

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Screenshot**: See "Domani" card at hours 5-8 in test screenshots

---

## Test Case 6: Combined Showers and Snowfall
**Test Data**:
- Showers: 2 mm/h
- Snowfall: 0.5 cm/h (5 mm water equivalent)
- Total: 7 mm/h equivalent

**Expected Result**:
- Red warning triangle (combined severity > 5 mm/h)
- Single icon per hour even with both types

**Status**: ✅ PASS (by design - intensities are summed)

---

## Test Case 7: No Precipitation Events
**Test Data**:
- Showers: 0 mm/h
- Snowfall: 0 cm/h

**Expected Result**:
- No warning icons displayed
- Chart renders normally

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Screenshot**: See "Dopodomani" card in test screenshots

---

## Test Case 8: Chart Mode Switching
**Test Steps**:
1. Start in precipitation mode with warnings visible
2. Switch to temperature mode
3. Switch back to precipitation mode

**Expected Result**:
- Warning icons disappear in non-precipitation modes
- Warning icons reappear when returning to precipitation mode
- No console errors during mode switching

**Status**: ✅ PASS (verified via console logs - no errors)

---

## Test Case 9: Mobile Gesture Support
**Test Steps**:
1. Swipe between chart modes on mobile
2. Verify warnings remain functional

**Expected Result**:
- Warning icons work correctly after gesture-based mode switches
- Icons positioned correctly on all viewport sizes

**Status**: ✅ PASS (verified via responsive testing)

---

## Test Case 10: Browser Compatibility
**Browsers Tested**:
- Chrome/Chromium (via Playwright)

**Expected Result**:
- Warning triangles render correctly
- Canvas drawing works properly
- Colors match specifications

**Status**: ✅ PASS
